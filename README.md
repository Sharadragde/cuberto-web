# Cuberto.com Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a clone of the **Cuberto.com** website, where I replicated key sections of the homepag using  animations, and modern UI/UX principles using **React.js** and **Framer Motion**.

## Implemented Sections
### âœ… Sidebar Navigation
- A slide-in sidebar that appears when toggled.
- Includes social media links and menu items.
- Custom cursor effects for a modern interactive feel.
- Smooth opening/closing animations.

### âœ… Hero Section (Home)
- Animated text with video integration.
- Custom cursor interactions.
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
### ðŸ”¹ **Alignment Issues in the Hero Section**
**Problem:** The text and video positioning was inconsistent across different screen sizes.
**Solution:** Used **flexbox** and **grid** techniques to achieve better alignment and responsiveness.

### ðŸ”¹ **Implementing Smooth Text Animation**
**Problem:** Ensuring the text moves up and reappears smoothly on hover.
**Solution:** Used **CSS keyframes** for animations, allowing text to move up, disappear, and re-enter seamlessly.

### ðŸ”¹ **Sidebar Animation Glitches**
**Problem:** Sidebar transition was Challenging and not smooth.
**Solution:** Used **Framer Motion** for better control over animation easing and smooth transitions.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** â€“ Component-based UI development
- **Framer Motion** â€“ Smooth animations and transitions
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **CSS Keyframes** â€“ Custom animations for hover effects

ðŸš€ **Future Improvements:** I plan to refine the animations further and implement more sections from the original Cuberto.com site!
